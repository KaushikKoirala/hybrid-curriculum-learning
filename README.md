# hybrid-curriculum-learning
This repository contains code and artifacts related to the course project for CMU's 11-785 Intro to Deep Learning course. In this project we are going to explore the performance of curriculum learning approaches (e.g., [data/blur based](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/f6a673f09493afcd8b129a0bcf1cd5bc-Paper.pdf) as well as a [Learning Rate Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09180)). In our main investigation we will seek to combine these two approaches and evaluate the impact on various models/architectures used for image classification (e.g., ResNet,CvT-13, ConvNeXt).
